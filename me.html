    <p></p>
    <blockquote style="text-align: left; color: white; font-family:Trebuchet MS">
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp So I was born in Quezon City from a womb of a loving mother that was accompanied by my two elder siblings.<sup>1</sup>
        Of course as a baby, I would eventually learn things such as how to read, walk, talk then slowly grow into the person I am today.<sup>2</sup>
        As soon I mastered the basics on how to function as your usual human being, I was then sent to school just to learn many more things and be useful to the family.<sup>3</sup>
        Learning was easy at first, being able to speak Tagalog and English, do math and draw cartoon characters, but of course it was all thanks to the cartoon shows that I would watch with my family.<sup>4</sup>
        Eventually my efforts of just grinding my studies paid off with me being an achiever in the primary cycle.<sup>5</sup>
        However, There was one thing that my family forgot to teach me and it was the basics of communication or in communicating others.<sup>6</sup>
        I am not saying that it was their fault but it was mine, I realized in my teenage years that in school, communication is the key in surviving my years as a student.<sup>7</sup>
        As a child at that time, I did not know how to communicate with anyone, the only thing that kept me company was the praises of the teachers for doing such a good job on getting perfect scores.<sup>8</sup>
        I was oblivious to the fact that what I was doing at that time was just me coping to the loneliness I was feeling during that time.<sup>9</sup>
        Now that I think about it, maybe It wasn't that i was oblivious but that I just didn't want to realize that I was a lonely kid, I was ignoring it and I didn't tell anyone about it.<sup>10</sup>
        Due to the lack of communication with my classmates, it eventually lead to an event where I would get picked on without fighting back, because I didn't know what to say nor what to do in a situation as that.<sup>11</sup>
        The first time that I got picked on was when I was doing a seatwork that was assigned to us students in my first grade.<sup>12</sup>
        I was the first one to finish, expecting to ace the seatwork given to us.<sup>13</sup>
        I suddenly wanted to talk to someone and communicate for ones, even though I didn't know what to say nor what to do.<sup>14</sup>
        I then approached someone whom I thought would be a good start in communicating for ones in my entire childish life.<sup>15</sup>
        The memory in that time isn't fresh so I cant remember what happened, all I know is that I was picked on for some reason.<sup>16</sup>
        It then lead me to the point as to not how to handle such a situation, I was taught how to read, walk and talk.<sup>17</sup>
        But I was never taught to communicate with other kids, I was only taught to talk to my parents and family members but never to those that are outside of that circle.<sup>18</sup>
        And on that point, it was that moment where eventually I didn't care if they picked on me which lead to the point where it became a cycle of getting picked on.<sup>19</sup>
        It affected my grades and also my confidence in myself, which was something I couldn't get out off at that time of my year.<sup>20</sup>

    <blockquote style="text-align: left; color: white; font-family:Trebuchet MS">
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Now this is where everything starts to go down but eventually, it would also lead me to the life I wanted.<sup>1</sup>
        After I graduated in my intermediate year, I was sent straight into junior high school.<sup>2</sup>
        Before that, I was thinking of either adding this in, and that is if I reached out to my parents about my experience from my primary to intermediate year<sup>3</sup>
        The memory is blurry during that time but maybe I did tell them on what happened.<sup>4</sup>
        Of course, I don't remember it myself on how they reacted since I decided back then to forget the bad memories.<sup>5</sup>
        Yes, a man like myself made his own memory eraser because of the sad memories that I have created and experienced.<sup>6</sup>
        But from my observations, the way they treated me back then was now more different ever, they were cold back then but I guess it was just there way of telling me that they love and care for me.<sup>7</sup>
        So from that point, they treated me more lovingly and they paid more attention so I wouldn't grow and be lead to a sad life.<sup>8</sup>
        Anyhow, It was my time to be a junior high school student and in that time I had many bad memories and rarely, very good memories.<sup>9</sup>
        Those bad memories were either caused by me or caused by others, but mostly it was me because I still had problems with communicating.<sup>10</sup>
        I did remember having a friend I had which was not a classmate but from someone outside my school.<sup>11</sup>
        They told me that maybe it was because I was choosing the wrong people to befriend, this was when they were basing my personality to theirs.<sup>12</sup>
        Indeed they must've been right but eventually i was too late, I was again stuck in that horrible loop of getting picked on while not knowing what to do.<sup>13</sup>
        Skipping to the time where i was in my second year, There was a band vs band event being hosted every year.<sup>14</sup>
        Hearing that, I decided to join in thinking it would be fun.<sup>15</sup>
        If the band was bad at playing the instruments just as I am, I decided that I would quit but when i joined in, they were very good which was something I was not expecting.<sup>16</sup>
        The band that I was with became a circle of friends that I thought I could shelter myself into, away from the bad people because whenever we would have practice sessions, I would just lose myself to the music since the one who created the songs was very good at it.<sup>17</sup>
        The leader was of course the one who created the music and we eventually became best friends, hoping to myself that the relationship wouldn't be temporary I decided to stay all the way until I graduated because the songs we kept on playing lead us to reaching third and second place, but never first.<sup>18</sup>
        Until, It was my last year in junior high school, we eventually won in first place which was one of the happy memories of my whole life, it eventually got me to regain my confidence but alas my communication skills still needed practice.<sup>19</sup>
        I then graduated from junior high school and got to bring myself a happy memory, but in senior high school, I also got a happy memory from that time since I got to be an honor student, making my parents proud and myself as well.<sup>20</sup>

    <blockquote style="text-align: left; color: white; font-family:Trebuchet MS">
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In my first year in college, Of course I was a shy man.<sup>1</sup>
        Literally I heard that this would be the time where your life can change, and that I was hoping would be true.<sup>2</sup>
        Of course, a man like myself went straight into focusing on my studies but as well as making friends while our classes were online.<sup>3</sup>
        Eventually at one point, one of my classmates until now created a group chat just to communicate with each other regarding our college issues and our professor issues.<sup>4</sup>
        As a man like myself, I decided to eventually get into such an activity and try to get to know those that would eventually be known as my classmates in real life soon.<sup>5</sup>
        After an executive amount of conversations, I eventually got to be in a group where I could be myself this time but of course without making a fool of myself just like how Rowan Atkinson would fight a bee while burning the whole house down.<sup>6</sup>
        I noticed that the group I was in had the mixture of the smart, gamer and average people.<sup>7</sup>
        It was a small group but they were funny, seeing how unique they were.<sup>8</sup>
        However, I was still lacking in the communication area which is still a problem.<sup>9</sup>
        But noticing on how they would treat me based on how I talk, I thought that it was fine to take things slow and interact as less as possible.<sup>10</sup>
        Now that I had some friends in college, It was at that point where I could finally study and aim for the top.<sup>11</sup>
        But eventually it failed miserably, just like how every protagonist would fail fighting the antagonist straight away without any powerful gear.<sup>12</sup>
        In all honesty, it was something that I needed to improve.<sup>13</sup>
        College can be a place where you can start over but it is an unforgiving place.<sup>14</sup>
        That is why I would work my butt off into studying every single time there would be an exam or a quiz.<sup>15</sup>
        I mean, my future and my life is on the line so there is nothing that I can do but work hard for it.<sup>16</sup>
        Nothing is free, If I wanted to be at the top then I needed to make some effort that could make some progress.<sup>17</sup>
        And eventually I did, It wasn't much but things were starting to get better.<sup>18</sup>
        I was able to fix my schedule properly and balance between my games and my studies since I'm also a gamer.<sup>19</sup>
        But even though I still have long ways to go in terms of my studies, I'll eventually get to the point where I can look back and say that I finally did it, but until then, since I'm still studying as a second year student in college, I'll work hard to get my confidence back all the while improving my communication abilities since there are days where we can now see each other in college.<sup>20</sup>
