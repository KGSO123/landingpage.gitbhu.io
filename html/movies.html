								A romantic comedy film that was based on the japanese film of <i>Josee The Tiger and the Fish</i> that was first released in 2003. Honestly, I like this version better because I personally don't want any explicit content in this story. It would just break the pureness in the romance the two characters have.

									The comedy movies of Rowan Atkinson playing as <i>Johnny English</i> now takes place in a part of the franchise where he is already retired and is forced to come back into the field in order to find the mastermind hacker. The plot is good but I just can't help but laugh whenever Rowan Atkinson would do something weird and funny. He did afterall play as <i>Mr. Bean</i>.
