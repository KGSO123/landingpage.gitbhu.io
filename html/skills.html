			 <div class = "description">I can code using the C++ language but I'm not really that good at coding with that language yet.<sup>1</sup>
			I can also code using the html langauge and code with it, however, it does not mean that I am good in it either.<sup>2</sup>
			I am studying two languages at the moment, not so difficult if you study at your own pace.<sup>3</sup>
			I am just hoping that I could choose between the two on what I would prefer to use for my future job.<sup>4</sup>
			Other than coding, I also do taekwando.<sup>5</sup><br></br>

			<br></br>
			Of course, I stopped participating in doing taekwando way back before I was about to be a high school student.<sup>6</sup>
			At that time, I thought I needed to learn self defense in order protect myself even though my parents were there for me.<sup>7</sup>
			So, whenever I would go home, my schedule was changed in having to do taekwando after school.<sup>8</sup>
			I still remember the techniques, but my body is far from capable of doing moves now.<sup>9</sup>
			Now that I've been avoiding activities that would make me move my body alot, it got pretty difficult trying to move just like that now.<sup>10</sup>
			</div>
        <center><h2 class = "headers" >Hobbies</h2></center>
		<p></p>
		   <div class = "description">The things that I do on a daily basis is practicing playing the guitar or the ukulele.<sup>1</sup>
			Whenever I would do that, it gives me a peace of mind as if the bad things I had been stressing out on just disappeared<sup>2</sup>
			I've been playing the guitar ever since my first year in high school.<sup>3</sup>
			However, ever since I've been so busy with college, I couldn't get a single opportunity to practice playing the guitar anymore.<sup>4</sup>
			The schedule that I arranged back then was now full of college activities, that's why I'm also having a difficult time calming down now.<sup>5</sup><br></br>

			Whenever I do have the time to play the guitar, I would always make sure to enjoy the precious time I have with just playing a couple of songs with my guitar.<sup>6</sup>
			Other than playing the guitar, I also know how to play the piano.<sup>7</sup>
			I don't mean by the big grand piano but the mini-sized ones, a keyboard piano.<sup>8</sup>
			It's true that I do have a lot of fun playing the guitar, but playing the piano is so much different.<sup>9</sup>
			Infact, I actually prefer playing the piano because of how creative I can be while losing myself to the music.<sup>10</sup>

        <center><h2 class = "headers">Interest</h2></center>
		<p></p>
		   <div class = "description">I've always been interested in many things.<sup>1</sup>
			Learning how to code, how to play certain instruments, how to cook like Gordon Ramsay.<sup>2</sup>
			There were many things that I was interested in so it's hard to pinpoint on which one that caught my attention more.<sup>3</sup>
			If I were to pick one right now, It would be the curiosity of playing the piano back then.<sup>4</sup>
			I would always tell my family about wanting to perform infront of many people playing the piano.<sup>5</sup>
			As a kid, the way those pro pianists moved their fingers gracefully as they press one note at a time, fast or even slow, it would always motivate me to play the piano even more.<sup>6</sup>
			And it was thanks to that curiosity that I was able to type quickly since I've been playing the piano for a long time now.<sup>7</sup>
			I also had a dream of wanting to be a famous person back then, a goal in life, not because I wanted the popularity, I just wanted to let people know that there are people like me where they can just do what they love the most.<sup>8</sup>
			So if I wanted to be famous, I had to do something that would get the worlds attention all the while doing the things that I love.<sup>9</sup>
			As I have said just now, there are a lot of interesting things I have in life that I am always curious about so it's very hard to pick just one. <sup>10</sup>
