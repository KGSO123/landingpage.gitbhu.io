				The reason I want to be in Los Angeles was because that a close friend of mine moved there. I really miss that friend of mine since we've been through a lot of life changing situations. We go way back when I was still in Junior High School, we used to play tons of games and hangout with the rest of our friends, those moments were something to treasure. I just hope that if I become succesful in life, I'll be able to visit that person and have fun like back  then.
