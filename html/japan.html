				The reason I want to go to Japan is to visit Tokyo City Central, my sister talked about it during her working travels in japan, she said that the area was huge and it was hard to take pictures during her visit because of how many people were crossing the street. It was indeed populated as I have heard. Not only that but the food cooked over there was delicious in Japan since she was able to eat different kinds of japanese foods other than your common onigiri, tonkatsu and ramen. I wanna experience what she had experience in japan someday.
