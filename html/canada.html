				The reason I want to go to Canda was because of the Nigerian Falls. Seeing as how beautiful the sight is in the pictures of other people, I wondered what it would look like if I saw it in person, my mother went to Canada once but was never able to visit the Nigerian Falls since it was just a work trip, she was restricted on going to places that her team was not supposed to go to. Someday, I'll be taking her once I get a proper job and tons of money.
