				The reason why I want to go to London was only because of my own curiosity. I wanted to also ride those huge red bus and just stroll around the city, hopefully I could also be able to experience driving in the London Bridge and just take a picture of it as well. Because not everyday I can experience being in such a historical famous spot.
